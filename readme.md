# 2D Interpolating implicit function

## Build

**Requirements:**  C++ 17 compiler, Qt5, OpenGL, Conan and CMake.   

To build the program, we should create a directory and move to it (In Linux):

```shell
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
```

Then, we should install the conan dependecies:

```shell
$ conan install ..
```

Finally, we run cmake and build the source code:

```shell
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

It will produces a binary which can be executed.
